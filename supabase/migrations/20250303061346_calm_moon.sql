/*
  # Initial Schema for Business Accounting Platform

  1. New Tables
    - `profiles` - User profiles with additional information
    - `businesses` - Business entities owned by users
    - `payment_receipts` - Records of payments received
    - `debtors` - People or businesses who owe money
    - `creditors` - People or businesses to whom money is owed
    - `purchases` - Records of items or services purchased
    - `invoices` - Invoices issued to debtors
    - `invoice_items` - Line items for invoices
    - `bills` - Bills received from creditors
    - `bill_items` - Line items for bills

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for proper access control based on business ownership
